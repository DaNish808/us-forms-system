# Common patterns for building forms

Some forms require custom validation, styles, or conditional information based on user input. Use these patterns to address those needs.

### In this guide

- Writing custom field validation
- Validating a field based on other fields in the same object
- Changing drop-down options based on data in another field
- Creating a block of text with no associated fields
- Conditionally hiding a group of fields
- Styling expanded or collapsed fields
- Conditionally including a page
