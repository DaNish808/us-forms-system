# Creating a new application with the US Forms System Starter App

The US Forms System Starter App creates the initial files, configuration, build process, and web server you need to start building your form.


1. Fork repo to create your own form app
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start editing the config to build your form: `/js/config/form.js`
4. Run app locally: `npm start`

For more information, including app installation instructions, see the [US Forms System Starter App README](https://github.com/usds/us-forms-system-starter-app#us-forms-system-starter-app).
