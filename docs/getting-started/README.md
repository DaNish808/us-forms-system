# Getting started with the Forms System Library

Depending on your needs, you can either create a brand new application from scratch or install the US Forms Library in an existing application.

### [Creating a new application with the US Forms System Starter App](getting-started/creating-a-new-application-with-the-us-forms-system-starter-app.md)

The US Forms System Starter App creates the initial files, configuration, build process, and web server you need to start building your form immediately.

### [Installing the library in an existing application](getting-started/installing-the-library-in-an-existing-application.md)

If your existing application has a web server to run the app locally, you can install the US Forms System Library in that app.
