### [Developer Experience vs. User Experience?](https://medium.com/@cramforce/developer-experience-and-user-experience-c4004354b32a)
Since the U.S. Forms System MVP will be heavily focused on DX, this article is relevant to checking/balancing against the end user experience. Also, a future iteration could have a third type of non-technical (but not end user) user, such as a content manager or non technical producer.

### [Choosing Our Preferences](http://ometer.com/preferences.html)
This article provides a compelling argument for why software should limit the amount of preferences when possible.

>...ideally preferences are optional and the default behavior is reasonable without intervention. Hard coding what can be hard coded has a lot of value.

>I find that users ask for a preference by default. If a user is using my app FooBar and they come to something they think is stupid - say the app deletes all their email - it’s extremely common that they’ll file a bug saying “there should be an option to disable eating all my email” instead of one saying “your craptastic junk-heap of an app ate my email.”
