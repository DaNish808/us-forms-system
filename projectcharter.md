# forms.gov Project Charter
The federal government maintains around 23,000 forms, which are used to carry out its essential functions and provide critical services and benefits. In the case of paper-only forms, workers spend innumerable hours recreating and quality checking handwritten entries. Where digital forms exist, they are often simply fillable PDFs that still require manual processing because the data isn't collected in a format that can be automatically processed. The need to manually process both of these types of forms leads to more than 11.4 billion hours of paperwork annually.

As we have seen in multiple USDS engagements, web-based forms created through user-centered design methods reduce the respondent burden while producing well-structured data to the agencies for ingestion. Assitionally, by using a common framework for building these forms, teams have seen a significant reduction in the amount of time required to build a form -- going from 5 months down to 5 days, in one example from the vets.gov team. This project creates a tool for building complex web-based forms significantly faster than existing methods, using best practices in user experience and data collection, validation, and transmission.
  
  
## Stakeholders
#### Who needs to be informed about progress and/or major technical decisions?
* Sponsor: Suzette Kent (OFCIO)
* USDS HQ: Matt Cutts, Eddie Hartwig
* VA Digital Service team: Vets.gov product lead (currently empty), Vets.gov technical lead (currently empty)
* DHS Digital Service team: Ben Warfield, Neil Sharma

## Project communication expectations
**What is the best method for staying in touch?**
* Hipchat: Paperless.gov channel used for daily communication amongst team members
* GitHub: us-forms-system repository is the  for tracking work
* Email for communication with people outside of the immediate project team

## What should status reports include?
Progress towards project goals, blockers

## Key Players
* Julie Meloni | Project Lead
* Ellen Butters | UX Designer
* Anne Kainic | Engineer
* Ju-Lie McReynolds | Product Manager

## Project goal
#### What will be the end result of the project?  
A foundation for optimizing the process of more efficiently building more useful, modern, and frictionless web-based forms through the creation of a public open-source forms library that will incorporate the U.S. Web Design Standards and include guidance and best practices for use.

## Scope
#### What is in scope?
1. The aggregation and public sharing of lessons-learned from multiple years of USDS projects involving the transformation of forms from paper to web-based.
2. The creation and public open-source release of a forms library based on the DSVA extensions to RSJF. This library could be used government-wide, and will incorporate the U.S. Web Design Standards along with guidance for data storage and integration best practices.
3. The use of this library in production by at least one agency (besides VA).
4. The creation of exemplars for conversion of high-value paper-based forms to web-based forms using this library.

#### What is not in scope?
* Support for additional form builders or rendering non-React components
* Integration with other government digital services (e.g. login.gov)
* Ability to save a form in progress
* Prefilling a form with existing information
* Non-linear form progress

## Milestones
#### â€¦including deadlines
* Worthy thing 1 - with date
* Worthy thing 2 - with date

## Dependencies
#### Are there other projects/people upon whom the success of this project relies?
* An agency team other than VA to implement a form with the library
* Others?

## Risks to completion
#### What are the potential risk factors that could keep us from meeting the project goal(s)?
* Not getting additional engineering resources
* Inability to find an agency team with a compatible project timeline/need for implementing a form with the library  

#### What do we assume we can rely on to achieve the project goal(s)?
* Executive support (?)
* Team time commitments (?)
  * Both Anne and Ju-Lie will remain 1x allocated for the full period of this project
  * Ellen will remain available at .5x for this project
  * Julie will continue to have continue to have .2x availability to contribute
* Contracted resources will be available to support the engineering efforts

## Exit criteria
We have successfully met our project goal (see project goals and exit plan).  
**or**  
We have partially met our project goal, but some milestones are not met.  
**or**  
We cannot meet our project goal due to external issues

## Exit plan
*If the project goal is met*  
The team will roll off the project once a working forms library with guidance, best practices, and exemplars is publicly released and in production use by at least one agency other than VA. Additionally, a plan for an additional scope of work for a follow-on project will have been created, which could include a plan for the long-term maintenance of the library

*If the project goal is partially met*  
If a working forms library is in place with supporting documentation, but examplars are not complete or an agency team has not been able to complete work to implement a form with the library, parts of the team may negotiate staying on to support that work.

*If the project goal cannot be met*  
If, due to internal or external factors, the project goal cannot be met, the team will roll off the project and the team will provide a retrospective to the Sponsor, Suzette King, and any other stakeholders identified by USDS leadership. The retrospective will include an explanation of barriers to success, summaries of any work completed and give access to any work in-progress. It will also include recommendations for moving forward, if possible.
