# U.S. Forms System (Phase I) Project Charter
The federal government maintains around 23,000 forms, which are used to carry out its essential functions and provide critical services and benefits. In the case of paper-only forms, workers spend innumerable hours recreating and quality checking handwritten entries. Where digital forms exist, they are often simply fillable PDFs that still require manual processing because the data isn't collected in a format that can be automatically processed. The need to manually process both of these types of forms leads to more than 11.4 billion hours of paperwork annually.

As we have seen in multiple USDS engagements, web-based forms created through user-centered design methods reduce the respondent burden while producing well-structured data to the agencies for ingestion. Assitionally, by using a common framework for building these forms, teams have seen a significant reduction in the amount of time required to build a form -- going from 5 months down to 5 days, in one example from the Vets.gov team. This project creates a tool for building complex web-based forms significantly faster than existing methods, using best practices in user experience and data collection, validation, and transmission.
  
  
## Stakeholders
The following should be informed about progress and/or major technical decisions.  This list may shift over time as we identify additional agencies to work with in Phase I.

* Sponsor: Suzette Kent (OFCIO)
* OMB Contacts: TBD
  * **TO-DO**: *determine full range of contacts in handover from Bryan Swann*
* USDS HQ: Matt Cutts, Eddie Hartwig
* VA Digital Service team: Vets.gov product lead (TBD), Vets.gov technical lead (TBD)
* DHS Digital Service team: Ben Warfield, Neil Sharma

## Project Communication Expectations
The team uses the following methods for communication:
* HipChat: Paperless.gov channel used for daily communication amongst team members
  * **TO-DO**: *rename channel to us-forms-system*
* GitHub: Code, documentation, issues, and Kanban project board is in the usds/us-forms-system repository.
  * **TO-DO**: *define community, contribution, licensing within GitHub*
* Email for communication with people outside of the project team
* Bi-Weekly internal meetings (in-person/phone) for project team, currently Mon and Thurs at 9:30am EST
* As-needed/requested in-person/phone meetings with other stakeholders

### Status Reports
This project uses internal and external status reports, as described below.
* **Internal** status reports are used within USDS, and are typically in "what have you done/what are you doing/what are your blockers" format during bi-weekly meetings.  At this time, no other regularly scheduled internal status reports have been requested by USDS Administration.
* **External** status reports are used to report to stakeholders within OMB such as OFCIO.
  * **TO-DO**: *determine preferred format, such as via email, in regular meetings, etc.*

## Project Goal
The end result of this project will be a practical technical foundation for optimizing the process of building  useful, modern, and frictionless web-based forms.  This goal will be achieved through the creation of an open-source library for building web-based forms using [React](https://reactjs.org/), also incorporating the [U.S. Web Design System](https://designsystem.digital.gov/) and including guidance and best practices for implementation. 
  * **TO-DO**: *finalize standalone site or in-repo wiki as the place to go for things*

## Scope
#### What is in scope?
1. The aggregation and public sharing of lessons-learned from multiple years of USDS projects involving the transformation of forms from paper to web-based.
2. The creation and public open-source release of a forms library based on the DSVA extensions to RSJF. This library could be used government-wide, and will incorporate the U.S. Web Design Standards along with guidance for data storage and integration best practices.
3. The use of this library in production by at least one agency (besides VA).
4. The creation of exemplars for conversion of high-value paper-based forms to web-based forms using this library.

#### What is not in scope?
* Support for additional form builders or rendering non-React components
* Integration with other government digital services (e.g. login.gov)
* Ability to save a form in progress
* Prefilling a form with existing information
* Non-linear form progress

## Milestones
#### â€¦including deadlines
* Worthy thing 1 - with date
* Worthy thing 2 - with date

## Dependencies
#### Are there other projects/people upon whom the success of this project relies?
* An agency team other than VA to implement a form with the library
* Others?

## Risks to completion
#### What are the potential risk factors that could keep us from meeting the project goal(s)?
* Not getting additional engineering resources
* Inability to find an agency team with a compatible project timeline/need for implementing a form with the library  

#### What do we assume we can rely on to achieve the project goal(s)?
* Executive support (?)
* Team time commitments (?)
  * Both Anne and Ju-Lie will remain 1x allocated for the full period of this project
  * Ellen will remain available at .5x for this project
  * Julie will continue to have continue to have .2x availability to contribute
* Contracted resources will be available to support the engineering efforts

## Exit criteria
We have successfully met our project goal (see project goals and exit plan).  
**or**  
We have partially met our project goal, but some milestones are not met.  
**or**  
We cannot meet our project goal due to external issues

## Exit plan
*If the project goal is met*  
The team will roll off the project once a working forms library with guidance, best practices, and exemplars is publicly released and in production use by at least one agency other than VA. Additionally, a plan for an additional scope of work for a follow-on project will have been created, which could include a plan for the long-term maintenance of the library

*If the project goal is partially met*  
If a working forms library is in place with supporting documentation, but examplars are not complete or an agency team has not been able to complete work to implement a form with the library, parts of the team may negotiate staying on to support that work.

*If the project goal cannot be met*  
If, due to internal or external factors, the project goal cannot be met, the team will roll off the project and the team will provide a retrospective to the Sponsor, Suzette King, and any other stakeholders identified by USDS leadership. The retrospective will include an explanation of barriers to success, summaries of any work completed and give access to any work in-progress. It will also include recommendations for moving forward, if possible.
