# forms.gov Project Charter
Constituents of the Federal government use some number of more than 23,000 different forms available to them to interact with agencies; these agencies use the information from these forms to provide information or benefits, but spend innumberable hours recreating and quality checking handwritten entries on the original paper forms. This method of manual form processing based on paper-only forms leads to more than 11.4 billion hours of paperwork annually. As we have seen in multiple USDS engagements, web-based forms created through user-centered design methods reduce the respondent burden while producing well-structured data to the agencies for ingestion. This project creates a foundation for optimizing the process of building more useful, modern, and frictionless web-based forms.

## Project goal
#### What will be the end result of the project?  
A foundation for optimizing the process of building more useful, modern, and frictionless web-based forms through the creation of a public open-source forms library that will incorporate the U.S. Web Design Standards and include guidance and best practices for use.

## Scope
#### What is in scope?
1. The aggregation and public sharing of lessons-learned from multiple years of USDS projects involving the transformation of forms from paper to web-based.
2. The creation and public open-source release of a forms library based on the DSVA extensions to RSJF. This library could be used government-wide, and will incorporate the U.S. Web Design Standards along with guidance for data storage and integration best practices.
3. The use of this library in production by at least one agency (besides VA).
4. The creation of exemplars for conversion of high-value paper-based forms to web-based forms using this library.

#### What is not in scope?
* Support for additional form builders or rendering non-React components
* Integration with other government digital services (e.g. login.gov)
* Others?

#### What do we assume we can rely on to achieve the project goal(s)?
* Executive support (?)
* Team time commitments (?)
  * Both Anne and Ju-Lie will remain 1x allocated for the full period of this project
  * Ellen will remain available at .5x for this project
  * Julie will continue to have continue to have .2x availability to contribute
* Contracted resources will be available to support the engineering efforts

## Exit criteria
We have successfully met our project goal (see project goals and exit plan).  
**or**  
We have partially met our project goal, but some milestones are not met.  
**or**  
We cannot meet our project goal due to external issues

## Exit plan
*If the project goal is met*  
The team will roll off the project once a working forms library with guidance, best practices, and exemplars is publicly released and in production use by at least one agency.

*If the project goal is partially met*  
If…

*If the project goal cannot be met*  
If, due to internal or external factors, the project goal cannot be met, the team will roll off the project and the team will provide a retrospective to the Sponsor, Suzette King, and any other stakeholders identified by USDS leadership. The retrospective will include an explanation of barriers to success, summaries of any work completed and give access to any work in-progress. It will also include recommendations for moving forward, if possible.
