Build React forms with JSON Schema and the U.S. Web Design System.

This library enables you to build digital forms using React and the JSON Schema standard. Instead of building and configuring your React components from scratch, you describe the form fields in a JSON Schema config file, which then renders the backing React components necessary to build your form.

Originally inspired by the [react-jsonschema-form](https://github.com/mozilla-services/react-jsonschema-form) library from Mozilla, we've created a version specific to how we build digital forms for government. Forms are styled using the [U.S. Web Design System](https://designsystem.digital.gov/) for a consistent look and feel across government.
